A solution to a randomly moving Knight via monte carlo simulation

The estimate mean number of moves from 10 000 simulations is 114, note that on other seeds, this value ranges between 111 - 116, performing more simulations should mean the value converges to 112.

The theoretical solution is

 - Dark blue: 42
 - Medium blue: 56
 - Light blue: 84
 - Yellow: 112
 - Red: 168
